# Geordie Hangman

## About

    Geordie Hangman is a simple game using slang words and saying from the north-east, specifically Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Be warned when playing the game is a lot harder than you'd think.

    The game can be played here: https://scottkelly36.github.io/Hangman/

    The app was deigned to showcase my skills in basic HTML5, CSS and Javascript using DOM manipulation to play the game.
